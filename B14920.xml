            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               </label> The Bow is so placed vpon the Pike with the Engine, that if any such seruice be required, (which is very seldome) then may the Bow very readily be slipped off the Pike, and so trailed therewith; and with as great readinesse slipt on againe: And also cheeking may be done with great agility.</p>

               </label> It is obseruable, that when you draw to close order, it is to receiue the enemy at the push of Pike, which when you so close your rankes, yet in file you allow so much distance one from the other, which may giue your armes liberty for to push with your Pike; which the bow doth no way hinder, for it is placed so fast vnto the Pike, that no trouble is therewith. Besides, when your front stands so charged, your middle men, and your reere, may doe good seruice with their arrowes vpon many occasions, for in such close order, you may vse your bow either against horse or foot.</p>

               </label> What we want in strength of our predecessors, we make good by our ingeniousnesse: For first, wee haue the helpe of the Pike, which serueth for a Rest for the bow arme, wherby we draw a very strong bow, as the Booke formerly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted doth specifie. Secondly, we haue now more exact skill in making both bowes and arrowes; and thereby we can shoot further, and more piercing, by reason of the aduantage that we haue in our arrowes, which are both nimble and flighty; whereby we are enabled to doe execution at the distance of 16. 18. or 20. score yards off. Thirdly, wee doe hereby double seruice, both with the Pike and with the Bow also, whereas without the Bow, the pikeman stands but as a marke for the muskettiers and horsemen, as is explained in the booke formerly named.</p>
